MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM!

I was required to follow the following steps:

Section 1:

a) Write a Python code to take in a user’s name using input() and then print out the name.
b) Also, take in a user’s age using the same method and print out their age.
c) Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line.

Section 2:

a)  Write a program that asks the user to order their 3 favourite food items on a menu using input(). Store them as variables item1, item2 and item3.
b) Print each item separately.
