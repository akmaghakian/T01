MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM!

I was required to follow the following steps:

a) Create a new Python file in this folder called hello_world.py
b) Inside this file, write Python code to take in a user’s name using input() and then print out the name.
c) Also, take in a user’s age using the same method and print out their age.
d) Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line.

Section 2:
a) Create a new Python file in this folder called menu.py
b)  Write a program that asks the user to order their 3 favourite food items on a menu using input(). Store them as variables item1, item2 and item3.
c) Print each item separately.
