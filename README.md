MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM!

I was required to follow the following steps:

Section 1:

a) To write a Python code to take in a user’s name using input() and then print out the name.

b) To take in a user’s age using the same method and print out their age.

c) Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line.

Section 2:

a)  Torite is a program that asks the user to order their 3 favourite food items on a menu using input(). Store them as variables item1, item2 and item3.

b) To print each item separately.
